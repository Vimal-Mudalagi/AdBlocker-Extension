# AdBlocker

This repository contains a simple AdBlocker application built using JSON files - `manifest.json` and `rules.json`.

## Installation

To use this AdBlocker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/Vimal-Mudalagi/AdBlocker-Extension
2. Open your browser's extension settings.

3. Load the extension as an unpacked extension:
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` for Google Chrome or `about:addons` for Mozilla Firefox.
- Enable "Developer mode".
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

4. Enable the extension.

## How it Works

This AdBlocker works by utilizing two JSON files:

- `manifest.json`: Contains metadata about the extension, including its name, version, and permissions.
- `rules.json`: Specifies the rules for blocking advertisements. Each rule defines a pattern or URL to be blocked.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed and enabled, it will automatically block advertisements based on the rules specified in the `rules.json` file.
